# `merklez`

*Experimental* binary merkle trees.
- immutable binary tree, to build data-sharing constructions with.
- lazy evaluation of hash-tree-root, `O(log N)` hash-tree-root cost on modifications.
- traversal isolated, to implement different navigation methods. Generalized indices work-in-progress.
